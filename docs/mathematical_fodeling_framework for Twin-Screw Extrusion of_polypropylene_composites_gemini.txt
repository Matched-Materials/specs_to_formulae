A Mathematical Modeling Framework for Predicting Polypropylene Blend Properties


This document outlines a mathematical framework designed to simulate the compounding of polypropylene (PP) impact copolymer blends in a twin-screw extruder. The model connects formulation inputs and process parameters to the final material properties specified in target_properties.json.


1.0 Model Inputs


The model requires two categories of inputs: formulation ratios from ingredient_library.json and process parameters from the extruder setup.
1.1 Formulation Inputs
The formulation is defined by the weight fractions (Wi​) of each component, which are converted to volume fractions (Vi​) for use in the property models using their respective densities (ρi​).
* WPP​: Weight fraction of PP Impact Copolymer
* WTalc​: Weight fraction of Micronized Talc
* WPOE​: Weight fraction of POE Impact Modifier
* Vi​=∑(Wj​/ρj​)Wi​/ρi​​
1.2 Process Inputs
These are the primary operational parameters of the twin-screw extruder:
* N: Screw speed (RPM)
* Q: Total mass throughput (kg/hr)
* Tbarrel,i​: Barrel temperature setpoint for each zone i (°C)
* Screw Geometry: A digital representation of the screw configuration, detailing the type, length, and order of each screw element (conveying, kneading, etc.).

2.0 Intermediate Process Variable Models


These models calculate the thermo-mechanical conditions experienced by the material as it travels through the extruder. These variables are critical as they directly influence the final material morphology and properties.
2.1 Residence Time Distribution (RTD) Model
The extruder is modeled as a network of ideal chemical reactors, where each screw element corresponds to a specific reactor type.1 This allows for the calculation of the mean residence time (
tˉ) and the distribution of time spent by the material in the system.
* Conveying Elements: Modeled as Plug Flow Reactors (PFRs), characterized by a fixed delay time.
* Kneading Blocks/Mixing Elements: Modeled as Continuously Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTRs), which introduce a distribution of residence times.
The mean residence time (tˉ) for a given section is calculated as:


tˉ=Q/ρmelt​Vfree​⋅ffill​​


where Vfree​ is the free geometric volume of the screw section, ffill​ is the degree of fill, and ρmelt​ is the melt density. The overall RTD of the extruder is the convolution of the RTDs of each individual element in series.1 The model outputs the mean residence time (
tˉ) and the variance (σ2) of the distribution.
2.2 Shear Rate (γ˙​) Model
The shear rate varies significantly depending on the screw element.
* Peak Shear Rate in Kneading Elements: The shear rate in the high-shear gap between the kneading disc tip and the barrel wall is a critical parameter for dispersive mixing.2
γ˙​peak​=h⋅60π⋅D⋅N​

where D is the screw diameter, N is the screw speed (RPM), and h is the clearance gap between the screw tip and barrel wall.
* Average Shear Rate in Conveying Elements: In fully filled conveying sections, the average shear rate is a combination of drag and pressure flow components.3 A simplified model is:
γ˙​ˉ​=h⋅60π⋅D⋅N​⋅kgeom​

where kgeom​ is a geometric factor dependent on the screw pitch and channel depth.
2.3 Specific Mechanical Energy (SME) Model
SME is a measure of the mechanical energy input from the motor per unit mass of material. It is a key indicator of mixing intensity.4
SME (kWh/kg)=QPmotor​⋅(%Torque/100)⋅ηgearbox​​


where Pmotor​ is the rated motor power (kW), %Torque is the measured torque, ηgearbox​ is the gearbox efficiency (typically ~0.97), and Q is the mass throughput (kg/hr).

3.0 Final Property Prediction Models


These models use the formulation inputs and the calculated intermediate process variables to predict the final material properties.
3.1 Melt Flow Rate (MFR) Prediction Model
MFR is primarily affected by polymer degradation (chain scission), which is a function of temperature, time, and shear. The model uses a two-step approach based on the change in weight-average molecular weight (Mw​).5
   1. Molecular Weight Degradation: The final molecular weight (Mw,f​) is predicted based on the initial molecular weight (Mw,0​) and the process conditions:
$$ \frac{M_{w,f}}{M_{w,0}} = \frac{1}{\exp\left(\frac{T_{melt}}{C_1}\right) \cdot \left[1 + \left(\frac{\bar{\dot{\gamma}} \cdot \bar{t}}{C_2}\right)^2\right] \cdot \frac{\bar{t}}{C_3}} $$
where Tmelt​ is the average melt temperature, γ˙​ˉ​ is the average shear rate, tˉ is the mean residence time, and C1​,C2​,C3​ are empirically determined degradation constants for the specific polymer system.
   2. MFR Conversion: The final MFR is calculated from the final molecular weight using a Bremner/Rudin-type power-law relationship 5:
MFRpredicted​=(Mw,f​KMFR​​)1/a

where KMFR​ and a are constants determined from experimental correlation of MFR and Mw​ for the base polymer.
3.2 Flexural Modulus (Ec​) Prediction Model
The modulus of the composite is predicted using the Halpin-Tsai model, which accounts for the modulus of the matrix and filler, the filler volume fraction, and the filler geometry (aspect ratio).6
$$E_c = E_m \left$$


where:


η=(ETalc​/Em​)+ξ(ETalc​/Em​)−1​
      * Ec​, Em​, ETalc​ are the moduli of the composite, PP matrix, and talc, respectively.
      * VTalc​ is the volume fraction of talc.
      * ξ is a geometric factor related to the aspect ratio (l/d) of the talc particles, often approximated as ξ=2(l/d).
3.3 Notched Izod Impact Strength (Ic​) Prediction Model
Impact strength is highly dependent on the dispersion of the elastomeric phase. This model uses a modified Nielsen equation where the effectiveness of the impact modifier is linked to the process intensity.8
Ic​=Imatrix​⋅1−ψVPOE​1−VPOE​​


where:


ψ=1+(ϕmax2​1−ϕmax​​)VPOE​
      * Ic​ is the impact strength of the composite.
      * Imatrix​ is the impact strength of the talc-filled PP matrix (without POE).
      * VPOE​ is the volume fraction of the POE impact modifier.
      * ϕmax​ is the maximum packing fraction of the dispersed POE particles. This parameter is modeled as a function of the process intensity, linking it to the calculated SME. A higher SME leads to better dispersion and a higher effective ϕmax​, thus predicting higher impact strength.

ϕmax​=f(SME)=ϕbase​+kdisp​⋅(1−e−SME/SMEcrit​)

where ϕbase​ is the packing fraction with poor mixing, kdisp​ is a dispersion coefficient, and SMEcrit​ is the critical specific energy for achieving good dispersion.
3.4 Heat Deflection Temperature (HDT) Prediction Model
HDT is strongly influenced by the presence of rigid fillers that enhance stiffness at elevated temperatures.9 A simplified empirical model is proposed:
HDTc​=HDTm​+(HDTmax​−HDTm​)⋅(1−e−kHDT​⋅VTalc​)


where:
         * HDTc​ and HDTm​ are the heat deflection temperatures of the composite and the PP/POE matrix, respectively.
         * HDTmax​ is the theoretical maximum HDT for the highly filled system.
         * VTalc​ is the volume fraction of talc.
         * kHDT​ is an empirical constant reflecting the stiffening efficiency of the talc grade.
