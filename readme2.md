Great. I’ll perform a full walkthrough of the latest version of your `spec_sheets_to_formulas` codebase. I’ll trace the data flow from reading spec sheets to goal-based filtering, candidate formulation generation, evaluation, and output. This will ensure that the system can autonomously process folders of spec sheets with defined goals like 'compostable' or 'recyclable', and produce scientifically credible formulas.

I’ll deliver the output as a structured Markdown report organized by function and module. I’ll also flag areas related to input filtering and formulation adaptability that could impact autonomy and correctness.
