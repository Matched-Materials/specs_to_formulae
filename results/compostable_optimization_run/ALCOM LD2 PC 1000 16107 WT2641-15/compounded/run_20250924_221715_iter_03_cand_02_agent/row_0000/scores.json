  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted material properties for this PP/elastomer blend are largely self-consistent and align well with established literature for thermoplastic olefins (TPOs). The trade-offs between stiffness (E_GPa), strength (sigma_y_MPa), heat resistance (HDT_C), and impact toughness (Izod) are classic and well-represented. The predicted room-temperature and low-temperature impact values are excellent, suggesting a high-performance material suitable for automotive applications.\n\n**Critical Flaw:** The primary and most severe issue is the predicted process torque of **0.25 Nm**. This value is physically unrealistic for a twin-screw extruder under the specified operating conditions (375 rpm, 5.3 kg/h) and formulation. A realistic torque would be at least one to two orders of magnitude higher. This indicates a fundamental error in the process simulation model, which severely undermines the credibility of the overall prediction, despite the plausible material properties.\n\n**Confidence:** Confidence is 'High' because the material property relationships are well-understood and the process torque error is unambiguous.",
