  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted property profile exhibits a major inconsistency regarding the elastic modulus, which undermines the credibility of the overall prediction. While several properties are plausible individually, their combination is not.\n\n**1. Key Inconsistency: Elastic Modulus**\n- The predicted modulus of **0.68 GPa** is exceptionally low for a formulation containing 6.6 wt% bio-fiber. Bio-fibers are reinforcing agents and are expected to increase stiffness. For a PP-TPO with ~20% elastomer, the baseline modulus is typically 800-1000 MPa. The addition of fiber should push this value higher, not lower. This prediction is contrary to established findings in polymer composites literature and suggests the model is failing to capture the reinforcing effect of the filler.\n\n**2. Impact Performance**\n- Room temperature Izod impact (47 kJ/m\u00b2) is excellent and consistent with the high elastomer content.\n- The low-temperature Izod impact (8 kJ/m\u00b2) shows a significant drop, indicating a DBTT that is likely too high for demanding automotive exterior/interior applications requiring cold-weather durability.\n\n**3. Other Properties**\n- MFI, yield strength, and density are plausible and internally consistent with a high-elastomer TPO formulation.\n- The low HDT (77\u00b0C) is consistent with the low modulus but is not a desirable characteristic for a fiber-reinforced grade, where improved thermal stability is a key objective.\n\n**4. Formulation Note**\n- The sum of the weight percentages in the input is 101.49%, which is a minor but notable discrepancy.\n\n**Confidence:** Confidence is rated **Medium** because while properties like MFI and density are reasonable, the fundamental error in predicting the modulus\u2014a critical structural property\u2014casts doubt on the model's predictive power for this formulation space.",
