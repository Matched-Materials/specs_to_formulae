  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted properties describe a highly tough and flexible material, but with very high viscosity and lower-than-expected stiffness for a filled compound. The property set is largely internally consistent (e.g., high toughness corresponds to lower stiffness) but shows some notable deviations from typical literature values.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n*   **Stiffness-Toughness Balance:** The combination of very high RT Izod impact (45.1 kJ/m\u00b2) and a low modulus (0.84 GPa) is the defining feature. While high toughness is expected from the elastomer content, the modulus seems unusually low given the 18.2 wt% CaCO3 filler loading. This could imply the model assumes poor filler dispersion or adhesion.\n*   **Melt Flow (MFI):** An MFI of 3.3 g/10min is extremely low for a typical automotive injection molding grade and suggests the material would be difficult to process. This prediction is only plausible if the base PP resin (`baseB_wtpct`) is a very high molecular weight grade, which is not specified.\n*   **Thermal & Physical Properties:** HDT, density, and crystallinity predictions are all well-aligned with expectations for this type of formulation and are considered highly realistic.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium. The evaluation is based on established knowledge of PP composites, but the lack of information on the base resin properties (especially MFI and modulus) introduces uncertainty, particularly in assessing the predicted MFI.",
