  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The prediction contains multiple critical, physically unrealistic values that indicate severe model deficiencies. The recommendation is to heavily penalize this result to guide the optimizer away from this region.\n\n**1. Critical Failures:**\n- **Density (`rho_gcc`):** The predicted density of 0.894 g/cc is physically impossible. The addition of 3.5% mineral filler (typically >2.5 g/cc) to a PP/elastomer base (~0.90 g/cc) must result in a final density greater than the base polymer. The prediction violates the rule of mixtures.\n- **Melting Point (`Tm_C`):** A `Tm` of 213\u00b0C is not characteristic of any standard polypropylene, which melts at 160-170\u00b0C. The model is likely confusing the process setpoint with the intrinsic material property, a fundamental error.\n- **Torque (`Torque_Nm`):** The predicted torque of 0.25 Nm is orders of magnitude too low for a real-world twin-screw extrusion process, bordering on idle/noise levels.\n- **Formulation Inconsistency:** The `filler_wtpct` is 3.51% while all specific filler types (`talc_wtpct`, `phi_f_talc`, etc.) are zero. This ambiguity makes a full evaluation difficult and points to a data inconsistency.\n\n**2. Plausible Aspects:**\n- The trade-off between stiffness (`E_GPa` = 808 MPa) and room-temperature impact (`Izod_23_kJm2` = 26.9 kJ/m\u00b2) is reasonable for a thermoplastic olefin (TPO).\n- MFI, yield strength, and the drop in low-temperature impact strength are all within expected ranges for this type of formulation.\n\n**3. Confidence:**\nConfidence is **High** due to the clear violations of fundamental principles of polymer physics and processing.",
