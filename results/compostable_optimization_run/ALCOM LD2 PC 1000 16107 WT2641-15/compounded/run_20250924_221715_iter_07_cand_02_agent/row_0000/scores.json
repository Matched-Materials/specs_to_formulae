  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted material properties show some internal consistency (e.g., Modulus-Yield-Crystallinity relationship) but are undermined by a critically flawed process prediction and an optimistic thermal property.\n\n**1. Realism & Consistency (Major Issues):**\n*   **CRITICAL FLAW (Process):** The predicted `Torque_Nm` of 0.25 is physically impossible for the given material and throughput. This value is orders of magnitude too low and suggests a severe error in the process simulation. This single parameter heavily penalizes the realism score.\n*   **SUSPECT PROPERTY (Thermal):** The `HDT_C` of ~80\u00b0C is highly optimistic for an unfilled TPO with a modulus of only 730 MPa. Literature suggests a value closer to 65-70\u00b0C would be more realistic, as HDT is strongly dependent on stiffness.\n\n**2. Plausible Predictions:**\n*   **Mechanical Properties:** The trade-off between stiffness (`E_GPa` = 730 MPa) and impact (`Izod_23_kJm2` = 49.4 kJ/m\u00b2) is characteristic of a well-compatibilized TPO with ~17.5% elastomer. The yield strength (`sigma_y_MPa`) is perfectly aligned with the modulus.\n*   **Flow & Microstructure:** The MFI of 25 is appropriate for automotive parts, and the crystallinity (`Xc`) is consistent with the composition.\n\n**3. Confidence:**\nConfidence is 'High' due to the clear and non-physical nature of the predicted torque, which is a fundamental process parameter. The deviation in HDT is also a well-understood relationship in polymer science.",
