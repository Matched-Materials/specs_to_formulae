  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The model predicts most individual properties within a plausible range for a PP/elastomer blend. However, a critical inconsistency in the predicted stress-strain behavior significantly reduces the overall realism and score.\n\n**Key Observations:**\n*   **Positive:** The predictions for Melt Flow Index (MFI), density (rho), Heat Deflection Temperature (HDT), and impact properties (Izod, Gardner) are consistent with literature for an unfilled TPO with ~11.5% elastomer. The trends of decreasing modulus and increasing impact strength with elastomer addition are correctly captured.\n\n*   **Major Inconsistency:** The relationship between Young's Modulus (`E_GPa`), Yield Strength (`sigma_y_MPa`), and Yield Strain (`eps_y_pct`) is physically questionable. Specifically, the addition of a ductile elastomer phase to a PP matrix is known to increase the strain at yield. The predicted `eps_y_pct` of 6.3% is characteristic of, or even lower than, a standard PP copolymer without elastomer. This contradicts the expected toughening mechanism and suggests a flaw in the model's understanding of the material's constitutive response.\n\n**Confidence:** High. The expected trend for yield strain upon elastomer addition is a fundamental and well-documented principle in polymer blend science. The deviation from this trend is a clear and identifiable flaw.",
