  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted material properties for this PP/elastomer blend are highly consistent with academic and industrial literature for a medium-impact TPO. The relationships between elastomer content and mechanical/thermal properties (modulus, impact, HDT) are well-represented.\n\n**Strengths:**\n- The trade-off between stiffness (`E_GPa`) and room-temperature toughness (`Izod_23_kJm2`) is very realistic.\n- The significant drop in low-temperature impact (`Izod_m20_kJm2`) is expected for this moderate level of elastomer modification.\n- Density (`rho_gcc`) and crystallinity (`Xc`) predictions align well with theoretical calculations for this blend composition.\n\n**Weaknesses & Concerns:**\n- **Process Realism:** The predicted torque (`Torque_Nm` = 0.25) is unrealistically low for the given throughput and screw speed. This value is a significant outlier and casts doubt on the process simulation aspect of the model, warranting a `realism_penalty`.\n- **Minor Property Discrepancy:** The predicted yield strain (`eps_y_pct`) is slightly lower than typically observed, though not entirely implausible.\n\n**Conclusion:** The model demonstrates a strong ability to predict material properties but shows a significant weakness in predicting realistic processing parameters (specifically torque). The formulation itself is a standard, credible composition.",
