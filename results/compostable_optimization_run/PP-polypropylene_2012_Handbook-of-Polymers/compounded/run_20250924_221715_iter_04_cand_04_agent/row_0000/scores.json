  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted *material properties* are largely self-consistent and align well with literature for a PP/elastomer TPO. However, the simulation suffers from critical, physically unrealistic flaws in the process parameters and formulation definition, severely reducing its overall credibility.\n\n**1. Critical Flaws (Low Realism):**\n- **Process Torque:** The predicted `Torque_Nm` of 0.25 is physically impossible. It is orders of magnitude below any realistic value for twin-screw extrusion of a polyolefin blend, suggesting a fundamental error in the process model.\n- **Formulation Contradiction:** The model specifies `filler_wtpct` as 4.65% while all specific filler inputs (`talc_wtpct`, `phi_f_talc`, etc.) are zero. This is a logical contradiction that makes the formulation's effect on properties uninterpretable.\n\n**2. Material Property Plausibility (High Literature Consistency):**\n- **Mechanical Properties:** The trade-off between stiffness (`E_GPa` = 0.71), strength (`sigma_y_MPa` = 20.6), and impact (`Izod_23_kJm2` = 43.8) is highly characteristic of an impact-modified PP with ~17% elastomer. The values are within expected ranges.\n- **Thermal Properties:** The low `HDT_C` of 79.2\u00b0C is a direct and realistic consequence of adding a soft, amorphous elastomer phase without the counteracting effect of a mineral filler like talc.\n- **Impact Performance:** The sharp drop in impact strength from 23\u00b0C to -20\u00b0C clearly indicates the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) is within this range, which is typical for non-optimized TPOs.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the predicted property interdependencies are sound, the simulation's invalid process and formulation inputs render it unreliable. The `realism_penalty` is set very low to reflect these critical flaws.",
