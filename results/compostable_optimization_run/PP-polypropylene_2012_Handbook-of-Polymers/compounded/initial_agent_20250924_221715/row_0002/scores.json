  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted properties describe a super-tough, high-viscosity TPO. While the high impact strength is consistent with the elastomer content, there is a significant inconsistency regarding the effect of the mineral filler.\n\n**1. Key Inconsistency: Stiffness and HDT vs. Filler Content**\n- The primary concern is the low predicted Flexural Modulus (0.84 GPa) and HDT (82.3 \u00b0C). A formulation with 18.2 wt% CaCO3 would be expected to exhibit a modulus well over 1.2 GPa and a correspondingly higher HDT. The model appears to underestimate the reinforcing effect of the filler or overestimate the softening effect of the elastomer. This is the main reason for the reduced `literature_consistency_score`.\n\n**2. Plausible Predictions:**\n- **Impact Performance:** The high room-temperature Izod (45.1 kJ/m\u00b2) and Gardner impact (36.7 J) are very plausible for a PP with ~15% elastomer content, suggesting effective toughening.\n- **Rheology:** The low MFI of 3.3 g/10min is consistent with the high processing torque of 50 Nm, indicating a high-viscosity melt. This is physically self-consistent.\n- **Density:** The predicted density (1.015 g/cc) is accurate based on a rule-of-mixtures calculation.\n\n**3. Confidence:**\n- Confidence is **High**. The relationship between mineral filler content and mechanical properties (modulus, HDT) in PP composites is well-established in literature. The deviation of the predictions from this known trend is clear and significant.",
