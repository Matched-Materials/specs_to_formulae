  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Primary Finding: Critical Contradiction in Predictions**\n\nThe model's predictions exhibit a major internal contradiction that violates fundamental principles of polymer blend science. This severely undermines the credibility of this result.\n\n**1. Contradiction: Compatibility vs. Toughness**\n- The model predicts a `compat_score` of 0.139, which indicates extremely poor interfacial adhesion between the polypropylene matrix and the elastomer phase.\n- In direct opposition, the model also predicts super-tough behavior (`Izod_23_kJm2` = 50.8 kJ/m\u00b2, `Gardner_J` = 48.6 J). \n- **This is physically unrealistic.** Achieving high impact strength in PP/elastomer blends is fundamentally dependent on creating a fine, well-adhered elastomer dispersion, which requires excellent compatibilization. Poor compatibility, as predicted here, leads to large, weakly bonded domains that act as failure initiation sites, resulting in brittle fracture and low impact strength.\n\n**2. Secondary Properties Analysis**\n- The predicted low modulus (`E_GPa` = 0.5 GPa), low yield strength (`sigma_y_MPa` = 20.2 MPa), and low heat deflection temperature (`HDT_C` = 69.2 \u00b0C) are all qualitatively consistent with a high elastomer content (~28 wt%) and the absence of reinforcing fillers.\n- However, the correctness of these secondary predictions is irrelevant given the primary, critical flaw in the toughness prediction.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe predicted combination of properties is not physically achievable. The model appears to be failing in this region of the design space, with its sub-models for compatibility and mechanical properties producing conflicting outputs. This data point should be heavily penalized by the optimizer.",
