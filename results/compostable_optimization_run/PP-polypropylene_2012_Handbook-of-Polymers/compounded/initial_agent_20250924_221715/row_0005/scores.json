  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted property profile shows mixed realism. While many properties (stiffness, impact, density) are internally consistent for a high-elastomer TPO, there are two major flaws that significantly reduce the score.\n\n**1. Formulation Realism (Major Flaw):**\n- The sum of all component weight percentages (`wtpct`) is 101.5%. This is physically impossible and indicates a fundamental error in the formulation definition. A `realism_penalty` of 0.5 has been applied.\n- There is a contradiction between `talc_wtpct` being 0.0 and the calculated talc volume fraction `phi_f_talc` being non-zero. This suggests a data pipeline error.\n\n**2. Property Consistency with Literature:**\n- **Melt Flow Index (MFI):** The predicted MFI of 4.7 g/10min is the most significant inconsistency. For a TPO with 24 wt% elastomer, which typically acts as a flow promoter, the MFI should be considerably higher (e.g., 15-30 g/10min for automotive parts). This low value suggests an extremely high viscosity material that would be difficult to process via injection molding and contradicts general literature trends.\n- **Impact vs. Stiffness Trade-off:** The trade-off between low modulus (0.57 GPa), low HDT (72\u00b0C), and very high impact strength (Izod > 50 kJ/m\u00b2, Gardner > 46 J) is well-represented and aligns with known TPO behavior.\n- **Density:** The predicted density (0.958 g/cc) is highly consistent with a rule-of-mixtures calculation for the given composition.\n\n**Confidence:** Confidence is 'Medium' because while the formulation itself is flawed and the MFI is unrealistic, the inter-relationships between most other key performance indicators are logical and follow established material science principles.",
