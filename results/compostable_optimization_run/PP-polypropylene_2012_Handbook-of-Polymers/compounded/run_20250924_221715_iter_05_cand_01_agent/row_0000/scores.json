  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted material properties are largely consistent with literature for an unfilled, impact-modified PP-TPO. Key properties like modulus, impact strength (RT and low temp), and HDT are plausible for the given formulation. However, two significant inconsistencies severely reduce the overall score.\n\n**Key Strengths:**\n- **Impact Properties:** The high Izod (48 kJ/m\u00b2) and Gardner (28.7 J) values correctly reflect the addition of 10.6% elastomer.\n- **Stiffness/Strength Trade-off:** The predicted modulus (0.93 GPa) and yield strength (22.3 MPa) represent a realistic trade-off for this type of compound.\n\n**Major Inconsistencies & Realism Issues:**\n1.  **Stress-Strain Relationship:** There is a fundamental contradiction between predicted modulus (`E_GPa`), yield strength (`sigma_y_MPa`), and elongation at yield (`eps_y_pct`). Based on the modulus and strength, the yield elongation should be approximately 2.4%, but the model predicts 6.0%. This indicates a flaw in the model's understanding of basic mechanical principles.\n2.  **Process Torque:** The predicted extruder torque of 0.25 Nm is physically unrealistic for the given throughput and material. A value 10-100x higher would be expected. This brings the realism of the process simulation into serious question and is the primary driver for the low `realism_penalty`.\n\n**Confidence:** The confidence is **Medium**. While many properties align with well-established trends, the evaluation is based on a single data point, and the presence of fundamental inconsistencies in both material and process predictions warrants caution.",
