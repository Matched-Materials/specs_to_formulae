  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**1. Overall Assessment**\nThe predicted material properties are largely self-consistent and align with established literature trends for polypropylene-elastomer thermoplastic olefins (TPOs). The classic trade-off between stiffness and toughness is well-represented. However, a critical process parameter (`Torque_Nm`) is highly unrealistic, which significantly lowers the overall realism score.\n\n**2. Property Analysis**\n- **Mechanical Properties:** The formulation shows good toughening. The modulus (0.85 GPa) and yield strength (22.1 MPa) are appropriately reduced for a blend with 13 wt% elastomer. The room temperature Izod impact (54.5 kJ/m\u00b2) is very high, classifying it as a 'super-tough' PP, which is optimistic but plausible given the 2.5% compatibilizer. The low-temperature Izod (9.3 kJ/m\u00b2) indicates the expected embrittlement, with a ductile-to-brittle transition temperature (DBTT) clearly above -20\u00b0C, which is common for such systems.\n- **Physical & Thermal Properties:** Density (0.895 g/cm\u00b3), crystallinity (40%), and HDT (84.4 \u00b0C) are all within plausible ranges for this type of unfilled formulation.\n\n**3. Process Parameter Realism**\n- **Torque:** The predicted torque of 0.25 Nm is physically implausible for a twin-screw extruder operating at ~6 kg/h and 480 rpm. Real-world torque values would be substantially higher. This single data point severely undermines the credibility of the process simulation aspect of the prediction and is the primary reason for the low `realism_penalty`.\n\n**4. Confidence**\nConfidence is 'Medium' because while the material property interdependencies are correctly modeled, the glaring error in a key process parameter suggests potential flaws in the underlying simulation's process-property linkage.",
