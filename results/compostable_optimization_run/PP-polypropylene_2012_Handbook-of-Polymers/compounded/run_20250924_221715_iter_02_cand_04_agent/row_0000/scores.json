  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted mechanical property profile (stiffness, strength, impact) is internally consistent and represents an attractive, tough TPO. However, this is severely undermined by fundamental contradictions in the physical and processing predictions.\n\n**Key Contradictions & Flaws:**\n1.  **Density vs. Filler:** The most significant flaw is the predicted density (`rho_gcc` = 0.896 g/cc). This value is correct for an *unfilled* blend but ignores the presence of 5.5 wt% filler. A standard mineral filler (e.g., CaCO3, d=2.7 g/cc) would increase the blend density to ~0.97 g/cc. This suggests the model completely fails to account for filler density. The input data showing `filler_wtpct` > 0 while all specific filler volume fractions (`phi_f_*`) are 0 is also a direct contradiction.\n2.  **Processing Physics:** The combination of a very high melt temperature (`Tm_C` = 219\u00b0C), low screw speed (`N_rps` = 3.8), and extremely low torque (`Torque_Nm` = 0.25) is physically implausible. High melt temperatures in extrusion are driven by high shear (high screw speed/torque) or external heating. A low-speed, low-torque process should not generate such high temperatures in a PP system. This points to a flawed process simulation.\n3.  **Thermal Stability:** A melt temperature of 219\u00b0C is well into the degradation range for polypropylene, which would negatively impact all mechanical properties and MFI. The model does not appear to account for this degradation.\n\n**Conclusion:** Due to the unrealistic density, temperature, and torque predictions, the simulation results are not credible. The model requires significant recalibration, particularly in how it handles fillers and simulates the core physics of the extrusion process. The attractive mechanical properties should be disregarded as they are derived from a flawed foundation.",
