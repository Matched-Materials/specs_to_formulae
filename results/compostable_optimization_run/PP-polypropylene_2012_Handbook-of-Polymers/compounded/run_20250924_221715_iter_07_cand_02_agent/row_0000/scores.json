  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The predicted material properties are highly consistent with scientific literature for thermoplastic olefins (TPOs). The trade-offs between stiffness, toughness, and thermal properties are well-captured. However, a significant realism issue exists with a key processing parameter.\n\n**1. Material Property Plausibility (High)**\n- **Mechanical Properties:** The combination of low modulus (0.72 GPa), moderate yield strength (20.9 MPa), and very high room-temperature impact strength (Izod > 50 kJ/m\u00b2, Gardner > 37 J) is characteristic of a well-designed, tough PP copolymer for applications like automotive bumpers or durable goods.\n- **Thermal & Physical Properties:** The predicted HDT (79.5\u00b0C) and crystallinity (38.5%) are fully consistent with an unfilled PP containing ~18 wt% elastomer. The elastomer phase correctly lowers both values compared to a PP homopolymer baseline.\n- **Ductile-to-Brittle Transition:** The sharp decrease in Izod impact strength from 23\u00b0C to -20\u00b0C is a classic and realistic representation of the material passing through its DBTT.\n\n**2. Processing Parameter Realism (Very Low)**\n- **Torque:** The predicted torque of 0.25 Nm is physically unrealistic for a twin-screw extrusion process, even at the specified low throughput (2.25 kg/h) and screw speed (~172 RPM). A realistic torque value for such a formulation would be at least one to two orders of magnitude higher. This suggests a significant flaw or scaling issue in the process model, which severely undermines the credibility of the overall simulation.\n\n**Conclusion:** While the predicted *material profile* is scientifically sound and desirable, the associated *processing prediction* is not. The `realism_penalty` has been set to 0.6 to reflect the severe discrepancy in the predicted torque. The optimizer should be aware that the model may be excellent at predicting material properties but poor at predicting process behavior.",

    "Torque_Nm_comment": "Predicted Torque (0.25 Nm) is unrealistically low. Expected values for a lab-scale TSE running a PP/elastomer blend would typically be in the 5-20 Nm range. This is the primary reason for the realism_penalty."
