  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:**\nThe predicted material properties are largely consistent with an unfilled PP impact copolymer containing ~13 wt% elastomer. The balance of stiffness (E=0.85 GPa), toughness (Izod_23=43.6 kJ/m\u00b2), and processability (MFI=25) is realistic for applications like automotive interiors.\n\n**Key Strengths:**\n- The trade-off between modulus, yield strength, and impact strength is well-represented for an elastomer-modified system.\n- HDT, density (0.895 g/cc), and crystallinity (40.2%) values are highly plausible for an unfilled system.\n- The low-temperature impact performance (`Izod_m20_kJm2` = 7.5) shows a characteristic drop, indicating a realistic ductile-to-brittle transition behavior common in automotive grades.\n\n**Major Concerns:**\n- **Process Realism:** The predicted `Torque_Nm` of 0.25 is extremely low and likely physically unrealistic for the specified throughput (3.95 kg/h) and screw speed (~308 rpm), even for a 25 MFI material. This single parameter significantly reduces the overall realism score and suggests a potential flaw or poor calibration in the process simulation model.",
