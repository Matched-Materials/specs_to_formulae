  "notes": "### Evaluation Report\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The model demonstrates good internal consistency, with properties like HDT and yield strength logically following from the predicted modulus and composition. However, there is a significant quantitative discrepancy with established literature, primarily concerning the flexural modulus.\n\n**1. Flexural Modulus (`E_GPa`):** The predicted modulus of 0.56 GPa is the primary concern. For a PP compound with ~25% elastomer and ~14% CaCO3, this value is unrealistically low. The stiffening effect of the mineral filler appears to be underestimated or negated, while the softening effect of the elastomer is likely overestimated. A value in the 0.8-1.0 GPa range would be more typical for this composition.\n\n**2. Impact Performance (`Izod`):** The predicted impact behavior is highly realistic. The large drop from room temperature (50.8 kJ/m²) to -20°C (8.7 kJ/m²) correctly captures the ductile-to-brittle transition. This behavior is consistent with a formulation having a very low compatibility score (0.2), which suggests poor interfacial adhesion and thus poor low-temperature performance, a key consideration for automotive parts.\n\n**3. Rheology and Density:** The MFI of 4 is plausible and consistent with the high viscosity implied by the process parameters. The predicted density (0.979 g/cc) shows excellent agreement with theoretical calculations, indicating the model handles component mass fractions correctly.\n\n**Confidence:** Confidence is 'Medium' because while the qualitative trends (e.g., more elastomer -> lower modulus) and inter-property relationships are sound, the absolute value of the modulus is a significant deviation from expected results, suggesting a potential flaw in the model's quantitative predictions for stiffness.",
