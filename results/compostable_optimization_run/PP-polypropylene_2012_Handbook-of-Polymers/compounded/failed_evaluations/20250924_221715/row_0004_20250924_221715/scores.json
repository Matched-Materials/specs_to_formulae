However, there is a significant quantitative discrepancy with established literature, primarily concerning the flexural modulus.\\n\\n**1. Flexural Modulus (`E_GPa`):** The predicted modulus of 0.56 GPa is the primary concern. For a PP compound with ~25% elastomer and ~14% CaCO3, this value is unrealistically low. The stiffening effect of the mineral filler appears to be underestimated or negated, while the softening effect of the elastomer is likely overestimated. A value in the 0.8-1.0 GPa range would be more typical for this composition.\\n\\n**2. Impact Performance (`Izod`):** The predicted impact behavior is highly realistic. The large drop from room temperature (50.8 kJ/m\u00b2) to -20\u00b0C (8.7 kJ/m\u00b2) correctly captures the ductile-to-brittle transition. This behavior is consistent with a formulation having a very low compatibility score (0.2), which suggests poor interfacial adhesion and thus poor low-temperature performance, a key consideration for automotive parts.\\n\\n**3. Rheology and Density:** The MFI of 4 is plausible and consistent with the high viscosity implied by the process parameters. The predicted density (0.979 g/cc) shows excellent agreement with theoretical calculations, indicating the model handles component mass fractions correctly.\\n\\n**Confidence:** Confidence is 'Medium' because while the qualitative trends (e.g., more elastomer -> lower modulus) and inter-property relationships are sound, the absolute value of the modulus is a significant deviation from expected results, suggesting a potential flaw in the model's quantitative predictions for stiffness.\",\n  \"extras\": {\n    \"calculated_sei_kWh_per_kg\": 0.3141592653589793\n  }\n}\"\"\"\n    ),\n  ],\n  role='model'\n) grounding_metadata=None partial=None turn_complete=None finish_reason=<FinishReason.STOP: 'STOP'> error_code=None error_message=None interrupted=None custom_metadata=None usage_metadata=GenerateContentResponseUsageMetadata(\n  candidates_token_count=1252,\n  candidates_tokens_details=[\n    ModalityTokenCount(\n      modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>,\n      token_count=1252\n    ),\n  ],\n  prompt_token_count=1635,\n  prompt_tokens_details=[\n    ModalityTokenCount(\n      modality=<MediaModality.TEXT: 'TEXT'>,\n      token_count=1635\n    ),\n  ],\n  thoughts_token_count=4226,\n  total_token_count=7113,\n  traffic_type=<TrafficType.ON_DEMAND: 'ON_DEMAND'>\n) live_session_resumption_update=None input_transcription=None output_transcription=None invocation_id='e-710f6e81-4bb4-48f6-860f-da3199fa1fa3' author='root_agent' actions=EventActions(skip_summarization=None, state_delta={}, artifact_delta={}, transfer_to_agent=None, escalate=None, requested_auth_configs={}, requested_tool_confirmations={}) long_running_tool_ids=None branch=None id='b3f5b98d-7976-48c9-9253-5827ff8afc92' timestamp=1758777612.525429",
